/**
DIVIDE-Engine: 21.10.2010 (Ionut Cava)

Mesh class. This class wraps all of the renderable geometry drawn by the engine.

Meshes are composed of at least 1 submesh that contains vertex data, texture
info and so on.
A mesh has a name, position, rotation, scale and a Boolean value that enables or
disables rendering
across the network and one that disables rendering altogether;

Note: all transformations applied to the mesh affect every submesh that compose
the mesh.
