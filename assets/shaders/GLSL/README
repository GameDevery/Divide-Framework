Shaders in the GLSL section are based of the shaders from the GLSL Demo from: 
http://yannick.gerometta.free.fr/base.php?id=glsldemo

No copyright is assumed from my part and no bad intetions
I did not find any license notes, so I assumed they are free to use as long as copyright notices,
like the one above, are placed.
